            She eyes me like a pisces when I am weak
            I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
            I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
            I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black
        </p>



         <p> 
            Hey, wait! I've got a new complaint!
            Forever in debt to your priceless advice

        <p>
            Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
            Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath
            Broken hymen of your highness, I'm left black
            Throw down your umbilical noose
            So I can climb right back
        </p>
